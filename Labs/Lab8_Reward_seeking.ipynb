        "In this assignment we study exploration in the very abstract $k$-armed bandit task.\n",
        "- In this there are $k$ actions to take.\n",
        "- Each returns a reward $R$, with some probability $p$.\n",
        "- The reward value is either a 1 or a 0.\n",
        "- This means the expected value of each arm is simply probability. Nice and simple right?\n",

        "### Action-value learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Our agents are really learning, at last. Reinforcement Learning (RL), to be precise. \n",
        "\n",
        "The reward value $Q$ update rule for all agents (below) and arm is the same:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ Q \\leftarrow Q + \\alpha * (R - Q) $$ [1]\n",
        "\n",
        "Where the learning rate on the reward prediction error ($R-Q$) is denoted as $\\alpha$, so that the equation above looks nice. If you are not familiar with the idea of a learning rate, it is what it sounds like. A parameter that controls how much each value update matters. This is, over time, the rate at which learning happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "$Q$ is trying to approximate the average reward value of each arm.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This kind of difference $(R - Q)$, the reward prediction error (RPE), in Eq [1] is the most typical error signal used for learnin gin RL.\n",

        "\n",
        "Once you have noodled that a bit, as needed, consider how making $\\alpha$ bigger or smaller might make $Q$ learning faster, or slower, or more or less volatile. (Learning speed and volatility _often_ go together; an annoying matched set.)\n",

        "_Note_: We are not going to really play with $\\alpha$ here. Just giving you some intuition.\n",

        "Our exploration strategies are a random one, a sequential one, or $\\epsilon$-greedy (aka 'e'-greedy). \n",
        "\n",
